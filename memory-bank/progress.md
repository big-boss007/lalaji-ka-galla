# Project Progress: Lalaji Ka Galla

## Current Status: Final UX/UI Refinements Implemented (Est. 85% Complete)

The Memory Bank documentation is established. The "Hello World" SvelteKit application was successfully created and verified. The main project, "Lalaji Ka Galla", has been initialized. Core functionality for the Home Screen and the "Modify Entries" screen (CRUD, Excel download) are implemented. Basic PWA features are set up. All requested UX/UI refinements, including pagination updates, heading removal, and button label changes, are complete. Authentication and Vercel deployment setup were attempted after this point and are now considered reverted.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level Overview) - At this reverted state

1.  **Main "Lalaji Ka Galla" PWA - Final Polish & Testing:**
    *   **Styling & UX Review:**
        *   Review component-specific styles to ensure they harmonize with the new global theme.
        *   Iteratively refine layout, typography, spacing, and add subtle animations/transitions as needed to achieve "Apple-quality" feel.
        *   Ensure responsive design is robust.
    *   **PWA Enhancements & Testing:**
        *   Test offline capabilities provided by the service worker.
        *   (If possible later) Add actual icon files to `static/icons/`.
    *   **Testing:**
        *   Conduct thorough functional testing of all features.

## Known Issues / Blockers
*   PWA icons are missing.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
*   (Standard entries about framework choice, Hello World, Memory Bank...)
*   Authentication feature was requested then deferred.
*   Vercel deployment setup was initiated then reverted.
