# Project Progress: Lalaji Ka Galla

## Current Status: UI Refinements and Stability (Est. 87% Complete)

The Memory Bank documentation is established. The "Hello World" SvelteKit application was successfully created and verified. The main project, "Lalaji Ka Galla", has been initialized. Core functionality for the Home Screen and the "Modify Entries" screen (CRUD, Excel download) are implemented. Basic PWA features are set up. Recent work focused on significant UI/UX refinements for the Summary screen and Edit Transaction Modal.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level Overview) - At this reverted state

1.  **Main "Lalaji Ka Galla" PWA - Final Polish:**
    *   **PWA Enhancements:**
        *   Add actual icon files to `static/icons/` and update `manifest.webmanifest`.
    *   **Final Documentation Review:**
        *   Ensure all Memory Bank documents are consistent and up-to-date.

## Known Issues / Blockers
*   PWA icons are missing (Next immediate task).

## Evolution of Project Decisions
*   (Standard entries about framework choice, Hello World, Memory Bank...)
*   Authentication feature was requested then deferred.
*   Vercel deployment setup was initiated then reverted.
